# Decen-Voting

Decen-Voting is a blockchain-based decentralized voting system that ensures transparency, security, and immutability of votes. This project leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless voting mechanism, reducing the risk of tampering and fraud while maintaining voter anonymity.

## 🚀 Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**: Ensures no central authority controls the voting process.
- **Immutable Records**: Votes are recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered.
- **Secure Voting**: End-to-end encryption ensures voter data is protected.
- **Anonymity**: Maintains voter privacy throughout the process.
- **Tamper-Proof**: Prevents fraud and manipulation through distributed ledger technology.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS for building an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic.
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum Smart Contracts written in Solidity.
- **Development Tools**: Truffle and Ganache for contract deployment and testing.
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask for secure transaction handling.
